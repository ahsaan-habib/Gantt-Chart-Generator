# Gantt Chart Generator

This PHP script generates a Gantt chart visualization based on user input. It allows users to input tasks with their start and end dates, and optionally specify dependencies between tasks. The script then renders a Gantt chart SVG image displaying the tasks along with their durations and dependencies.

## How to Run

To run the Gantt Chart Generator script, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt.

4. Run the PHP built-in web server with the following command:

   ```bash
   php -S localhost:4000
   ```

5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000` to access the script.

6. Use the form to input tasks, start dates, end dates, and dependencies. Click "Add Task" to add a task to the Gantt chart.

7. The Gantt chart will be dynamically updated with each task added. Dependencies are displayed as arrows between tasks.

8. To stop the PHP web server, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal or command prompt where it is running.

## Requirements

- PHP installed on your local machine.
